					Read Me: Linked List

All my methods passed the JUNIT Test for myself and when I used Minnal's test it didn't work automatically because of my removeMethod was different and I adjusted my methods so it worked for both mine and Minnal. I need to make a temporary node. All my mehtods work and when I tested your methods I was able to debug and write the remove method. I adjusted the test methods so it didn't have to take brackets.
